polish support for write operations (create, update)
add blobstore support
write python API client
write test suite using python API client
    CRUD with ndb / blobstore
    filter / sort / limit / offset
    authentication / authorization
check the accept header, and support HTML output (GET only)
break fieldtype-specific (de-)serialization (HTML and JSON) support into it's own file
support all stock fieldtypes (these will probably be added as I use them in an app)
